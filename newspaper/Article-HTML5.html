			<p><b>The head and body length of a red panda measures 50 to 64 cm (20 to 25 in), and its tail is 28 to 59 cm (11 to 23 in). Males weigh 3.7 to 6.2 kg (8.2 to 13.7 lb) and females 3 to 6.0 kg (6.6 to 13.2 lb).</b> They have long, soft, reddish-brown fur on the upper parts, blackish fur on the lower parts, and a light face with tear markings and robust cranio-dental features.<b>The light face has white badges similar to those of a raccoon, but each individual can have distinctive markings.</b> Their roundish heads have medium-sized upright ears, black noses, and blackish eyes. Their long, bushy tails with six alternating transverse ochre rings provide balance and excellent camouflage against their habitat of moss- and lichen-covered trees.The legs are black and short with thick fur on the soles of the paws. <b>This fur serves as thermal insulation on snow-covered or icy surfaces and conceals scent glands, which are also present on the anus.</b>
